# json-to-json (j2j)

This is the tool to use to transform JSON from one structure to another. This can be used to transform object graphs, e.g. take a document from mongodb and then transform it for use in the web services layer. After that, you can take that intermediate JSON and use the [j2m](../json-to-markup) tool to transform it into markup for the front end.
