# What is all this about?

React.js is a really cool tool but I don't like the notion of JSX, i.e. embedding XML tags within JavaScript. The usage is brilliant but it's the violations of JavaScript syntax that bug me. So I decided to try my hand at coming up with an alternative that uses JSON.

# What else?

The other thing that dawned on me as I thought about all this is that I could use similar techniques to transform the JSON into other things than web code. Why not use the techniques to produce more JSON which could then be used for other things like persisting to mongodb or couchbase?

# We'll see what happens

This project is experimental right now but I have a funny feeling it could lead somewhere...
